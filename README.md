## ðŸ§  Understanding Deep Learning â€” Notebooks & Solutions

This repository contains solutions, implementations, and notes based on the book **"Understanding Deep Learning"**. The notebooks are organized by chapter and cover key concepts in deep neural networks.

## Contents

Each notebook corresponds to a chapter of the book:

- [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/camargoOzen/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Notebooks/SupervisedLearning)
- [Shallow Neural Networks](https://github.com/camargoOzen/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Notebooks/ShallowNeuralNetworks)
- [Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/camargoOzen/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Notebooks/DeepNeuralNetworks)
- [Loss Functions](https://github.com/camargoOzen/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Notebooks/LossFunctions)
- [Fitting Models](https://github.com/camargoOzen/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Notebooks/FittingModels)
- [Greadients and Initialization](https://github.com/camargoOzen/Deep-Learning/tree/main/Notebooks/GradientsAndInitialization)
- *(More coming soon)*
